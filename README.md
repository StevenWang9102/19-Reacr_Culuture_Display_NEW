## Introduction
- This is a website that I mainly practice CSS 2D and 3D effects, Js DOM control as well. 

- I design some floating body effects and make different sections visible or hidden according to their position. 

- Also, I produce a lot of hover effects of buttons and use "setTimeout" function. 

Here is a video that shows basic functions of this website: https://youtu.be/o9HdU1la_HA
