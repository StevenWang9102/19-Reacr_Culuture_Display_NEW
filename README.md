## Introduction
This is a website that I mainly practice CSS 2D and 3D effects, Js DOM control as well. 

I design some floating body effects and make different sections visible or hidden according to their position. 

Also, I produce a lot of hover effects of buttons and use "setTimeout" function. 

Here is a video that shows basic functions of this website: https://youtu.be/o9HdU1la_HA


## How does it work

You can see my video which gives a brief operation video or plays with it on my hosted website online (http://react-culture-display.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com).

If you want to find more, you can see my source code and run "npm start" in the VS Code terminal.
